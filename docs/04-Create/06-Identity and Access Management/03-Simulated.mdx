## Overview

This section will go through how to simulate User and Access Management for an Assistant. The steps consist of: 

1. Create a variable assigned to an expression of a dictionary within the assistant platfrom and include the necessary users and their appropriate metadata within the dictionary.
2. Modify the "Greet Customer" action within the assistant

### Variable Creation
1. Within the "Actions" section of the Assistant navigate to the "Created by you" variables and select "New Variable+"
2. Create a variable name and set variable type to "Any"
3. Update the "initial value":
    - Toggle the "Use Expression" to on
    - Create dictionary value:
        
        ex)
        ```
        [
            {
                "name":"martha",
                "password":"MARTHA",
                "access":"Admin",
                "role":"Manager"
            },
            {
                "name":"robert",
                "password":"ROBERT",
                "access":"Employee",
                "role":"Employee"
            }
        ]
        ```
4. Click "Save"

### Modify "Greet Customer" action
- Within the "Actions" section of the Assistant, navigate to the "Greet Customer" action

#### **Authenticate User**
1. Check valid user by setting a new boolean variable to an expression value of:

    ``` !(( [users variable from "Variable Creation" step above]).filter("user", "user.name ==  [current_user value]")).isEmpty()) ```

    Example)

2. Ensure valid password by creating conditional statement with expression value of :

    ``` [current_password value] == (users.filter("user", "user.name == [current_user value]"))[0].password  ```

    Example)
    <img src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/386696/files/30d212c3-063e-43e9-ad90-abc933f35e52" alt="Valid Password Assistant Example" width="600"/>

#### **Change User's Password**
1. Set a new password for the current user with an expression like:
    ```((( ${users}.filter(\"user\", \"user.name ==  ${current_user} \"))[0]).password) = ${new_pass}```
2. Validate changed password with:
    ```((( ${users}.filter(\"user\", \"user.name ==  ${current_user} \"))[0]).password) ```
